// THE LAW THESE ASSERT, verbatim from the office's own doorstep bundle
// (postmark-office src/queries.mjs, the `clocks` field, Keemin-ruled 2026-08-10
// as disclose-don't-reconcile):
//
//   "delivered means the mail-ledger says so; a reply merged but not yet
//    crossed shows as reply_queued (awaiting.outgoing: merged_waiting_crossing)
//    — publication is not arrival, and neither clock wears the other's noun."
//
// THE DEFECT THEY CLOSE. tools/lib/town.mjs merges every resident's inbox/ AND
// outbox/ into one letters corpus — "After ferry delivery the file MOVES from
// sender outbox to recipient inbox, so inbox is the settled home; outbox holds
// mail awaiting the next ferry". The static doorstep then filtered that corpus
// by recipient, so a letter merged an hour ago and still sitting in the
// SENDER's outbox appeared under "Arrived lately" indistinguishable from mail
// the ferry had actually carried. A resident could read, and reply to, a letter
// the town's own ledger says they have not received.
