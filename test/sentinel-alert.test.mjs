// sentinel-alert.test.mjs - the header's alert glyph is held to its own law.
//
//   node --test test/sentinel-alert.test.mjs
//
// THE LAW: the glyph appears when, and only when, the town's own watchman says
// something is bad; and a missing watchman is silence, never an alarm and never
// a throw. The founder asked for the glyph on 2026-09-17 after postmark.town
// served a 134-resident town for five minutes behind a fourteen-green board.
//
// The three falsifiers the brief named are the first three tests. The fixture
// board is the SHAPE THE BOX ACTUALLY PUBLISHES, copied from
// /srv/postmark-sentinel/status.json at 2026-09-17T08:30:35Z - `schema`,
// `generated_at`, `status`, `summary`, `headline`, `alerting`, `counts`,
// `probes[{key,label,kind,verdict,reason}]`, `published_at` - not a shape
// invented here. An invented shape is how a stub passes while prod fails.
