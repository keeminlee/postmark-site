// old row stands down while the dock is mounted, and the dock's selection is
// the one the viewer follows.

//
// "Clicking a point on the map while acting as a walker should prefill/dispatch
// the walk to that point. Clicking a thing offers its context acts with the
// object prefilled."
//
// THE SEAM AND ITS WEAKNESS, pinned together on purpose. The viewer's delegated
// click handler reads `e.target.closest(".stand")` and hands the coordinates to
// its own chooseWalkPoint — and NOTHING IN THE VIEWER CARRIES THAT CLASS, in the
// pinned build or on the branch the pin is heading to. The hook is live and its
// elements are gone. It is the only walk route the viewer publishes (its window
// handle carries rerender/reload/stop and no walk of any kind), so the cockpit
// mints one and clicks it — the same move the page's arrival island already
// makes against `.ctl[data-x]`.
//
// Leaning on a vestigial hook is only safe because the result is CHECKED, which
// is what the second test here exists to keep true. If the world lane ever tidies
// that handler away, the reader is told the shortcut is not working rather than
// left clicking a map that quietly does nothing.

// path", which pinned the mint-and-click of a `.stand` element into a hook the
// viewer publishes but has no elements behind; and "the vestigial hook is
// verified, not trusted", which pinned the receipt that checked the desk had
// actually opened. Both were right for the ruling they served — the viewer owned
// walking, so the cockpit borrowed it rather than re-implementing pathing.
//
// THE GOVERNING RULING makes walking an ordinary act of the one flow ("in both
// cases, the next step IS the right side panel popup that has the WHO, the FROM,
// and the TO … and the CONFIRM button") and stands the viewer's desk down. A
