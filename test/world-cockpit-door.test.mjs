// The cockpit's arithmetic has been under test since it was written, and all 34 of
// those assertions were green on 2026-08-26 while the bar they describe never once
// appeared on a page. Every one of them was handed a fixture answer. Nothing asked
// what happened between the door and the fixture, because that part lived in an
// IIFE inside a .astro <script> where there was no seam to hand a stub to.
//
// So this file tests the part that was untestable: the composition that fetches
// the apex, the gate that decides whether anything mounts, and the markup that
// comes out the far end. It is fed a STUBBED DOOR that behaves the way the live
// office behaved when this was measured on 2026-08-27 — 422 for a read that names
// no resident, the real answer for one that does.
//
// Every assertion carries the sentence of law or the measurement it is asserting,
// because a brief is lossy and a test that paraphrases its reason drifts from it
// in silence.
