// Each test name quotes the guardrail it asserts, verbatim from the ruling that
// created it, and each guardrail is falsified in BOTH directions: the case that
// must advance and the case that must refuse. A fallback that fires on every
// input is not a fallback, it is a broken mechanism that looks safe — so the
// fallback tests are always paired with a healthy case that must NOT fall back.
//
// Nothing here touches the network. Both seams that do (`lsRemote`,
// `floorSettlementOf`) are injected, which is the whole reason they are seams.
