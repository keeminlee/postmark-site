// train-week-check.mjs — A TRAIN IS A WEEK'S SHIP, NAMED FOR THE WEEK IT SHIPS IN.
//
// The law (blueprints documentation/OPERATIONS.md § Release Day, founder-ruled
// 2026-08-31): release day is SUNDAY, the first day of the release week —
// `train/2026-w37` is the train that ships Sunday 2026-09-06, and
// `train/2026-w(NN+1)` opens THAT day, after w(NN) ships. Extra work during the
// week lands on the open train. A prod ship cut off main mid-week is a patch
// tag of the CURRENT release week (`release/2026-w36.15`), never the next.
//
// Why this is a check and not a sentence: on 2026-09-03 (a Thursday in release
// week 36) the w37 train was merged to main four days early, `release/2026-w37`
// was cut, and a `train/2026-w38` was proposed for the next lane — the founder:
// "it's bothering me that we're on w38 when it's still w36 … I already said
// this before." A rule in a file is coverage; a rule the work must pass through
// is enforcement. This runs in the release workflows and the hand-carry recipe.
//
//   node tools/train-week-check.mjs <ref>            e.g. train/2026-w37 · release/2026-w36.15 · refs/heads/train/2026-w37
//   node tools/train-week-check.mjs <ref> --on 2026-09-03   (the date to judge against; default today, America/New_York)
//   node tools/train-week-check.mjs --self-test        (the check can fail: every rule flipped red once)
//
// Exit 0 = lawful. Exit 1 = refused, with the sentence that names the fix.
// Exit 0 with a WARN line = flexed by the founder's word (the FLEXED table).
//
// THE WEEK ARITHMETIC. A release week starts Sunday. Its number is the ISO week
// of the Monday inside it — so Sunday 2026-09-06 begins release week 37 (ISO
// week of Monday 09-07 = 37), and Thursday 2026-09-03 sits in release week 36.
// `currentWeek(date)` = the release week the date is in; the OPEN train is
// `currentWeek + 1`; a mid-week tag is `currentWeek.N`; on release day (Sunday)
// the train `currentWeek` ships and its tag is `release/2026-w<currentWeek>`.
