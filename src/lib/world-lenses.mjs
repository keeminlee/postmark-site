// world-lenses.mjs — the readings the /ops/graph/ lenses paint with.
//
// Every function here takes the office's `GET /world/graph` node data and
// returns a reading of it. Nothing fetches, nothing draws, nothing caches: the
// page owns the canvas and the office owns the world, and what lives here is
// only the arithmetic between them — which is the part worth testing without a
// browser.
//
// PORTED, NOT INVENTED. These are the graph-views hub's own derivations
// (jetto/graph-views, tools/graph-views.mjs; its tip is pinned durably at world
// wright/hub-pin @ 013c0c7e), carried over when the founder ruled that the hub's
// CONTENT pours into this page and its six-tab chrome retires. The hub computed
// them in Node against a world clone on disk; here they run in the browser
// against the payload, which is the whole difference the ruling asked for — the
// hub's numbers were a snapshot of whatever clone the operator had, and these
// are a reading of the store the office is serving right now.
//
// V2 (2026-08-13 cutover). The V1 tier-gap reading is GONE from this file, not
// disabled: the founder ordered the gap FIXED world-side rather than watched, so
// a viewer for it would be a window onto a thing that no longer happens. What
// replaces it is the rest of the hub's V2 material — the law's own measures, the
// class registry's reach, the per-node serialization verdict, and the named
// boundary of what this window can honestly count at all.
//
// THE ONE THING THAT MADE THE PORT POSSIBLE. The hub could re-read every
// mark.md through the world's own parser, so it could ask "what did the AUTHOR
// write". The payload could not be asked that at all: `loadMarks` defaults
// `tier` to "market" and synthesizes half the identity, so by the time a record
// reaches a reader "the author wrote market" and "the loader supplied it" are
// the same string. The office now ships the author's own key list on each mark
// node (`keys`), which is what these readings stand on — and every one of them
// degrades to a stated "the office has not sent this yet" rather than a wrong
// number when it is absent.
//
// NO NUMBER FROM ANY PARTICULAR DAY IS WRITTEN DOWN HERE. Every count is
// computed from the payload in hand. The world is mid-cutover and the whole
// point of these readings is to watch figures move; a literal baked in as a
// comparison would be a claim about a store nobody is looking at.

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE SERIALIZATION MAP — the machine-readable form of the trichotomy that
// LOGOS/kinds.md § the node holds as prose.
//
// PORTED VERBATIM from tools/graph-views.mjs (world repo, branch
// jetto/graph-views), where it landed as a tracked artifact under founder ruling
// 2026-08-12 (WRITE-REGISTRY.md row "the serialization mapping (field →
// predicate star)").
//
// IT IS A TABLE, NOT A READING, which is why it may live in the site's tree at
// all: this page bakes no world data, and a founder-authored table of what a
// field MEANS is not world data. The counts against it are computed live from
// the payload every time the page opens.
//
// It is a WAY STATION. The destination is `payload schemas on class-nodes`
// (LOGOS/classes.md names payload schema as a class param), at which point this
// literal is deleted and the map is read from the graph like everything else.
//
// Read it per class: for each node class, what its frontmatter keys serialize.
//   identity   — an identity atom (kinds.md: "identity is two atoms, a slug and
//                a class"); the slug is the directory name, so on disk identity
//                is one key.
//   relational — NOT a property. Each entry names THE EDGE IT SERIALIZES, as
//                `[edge-type, what the edge relates]` (kinds.md: "`by:` is the
//                create-edge, not a field").
//   derived    — belongs NOWHERE (the-north-star.md § the placement discipline).
//                A key here on disk is TRUE RESIDUE: the map deliberately maps
//                it to nothing, which is a violation, not a gap in this table.
//   log        — belongs to the citing action's record, not to the node.
//   property   — a genuine authored property, given as `[predicate-slot, gloss]`.
//
// `*` applies to every class; a class block adds to it. A key on disk that this
// table does not place is MAPPING DEBT — rendered loudly as this table's own
// unfinished business, never silently bucketed, because an unrecognised field is
// exactly the shape a shadow grammar arrives in.

// ── what this window cannot count, and why ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The hub read a whole world clone: WORLD/marks, STATE/log/*.jsonl,
// WORLD/world-state.json, WORLD/walk-ledger.md, WORLD/households.json and
// WRITE-REGISTRY.md. This page reads ONE payload, the office's `GET
// /world/graph`, and that payload is a picture of the store — nodes and edges —
// and nothing else.
//
// So a run of the hub's readings cannot be computed here, and the honest port of
// those is not silence and not an approximation: it is the hub's own holes
// idiom, which named each absence and tied it to the registry row it belongs to
// rather than filling it with invented data. Each entry below says WHAT is
// unmeasurable, WHERE the substrate lives, and — this is the part that makes it
// a finding rather than an apology — that the reason it is not in this window is
// that it is not in the graph, which is the very thing the cutover is about.
//
// These are STATIC descriptions of a boundary, not counts, so nothing here goes
// stale as the world moves.
