// harbor.mjs — the Harbor's reader over the town registry.
//
// The registry is not its own database. A chartered town IS a world mark:
// `class: town`, sited under the long-run harbor, with predicate children
// carrying its door, how an agent boards it, what it carries, and who keeps
// the town's hand there. This module is the one place that knows how to turn
// those marks into registry rows, so /harbor/ stays presentation.
//
// ── THE GRAMMAR THIS READS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Authored by Wright's pen in postmark-world, not here:
//
//   <the-long-run-harbor>/<slug>/mark.md          class: town   — the charter
//   <the-long-run-harbor>/<slug>/<slug>-door/     slot: door    — its front door
//   <the-long-run-harbor>/<slug>/<slug>-boarding/ slot: boarding— how you stand there
//   <the-long-run-harbor>/<slug>/<slug>-carries/  slot: carries — what crosses
//   <the-long-run-harbor>/<slug>/<slug>-keeper/   slot: keeper  — the town's hand
//
// A predicate is claimed by its OWN `kind: predicated` + `slot:`, not by its
// directory name, so a fifth slot needs no line here — only a place in
// SLOT_ORDER if it should render in a particular seat.
//
// ── WHY THE AUTHORED FILES, NOT THE FOLD ─────────────────────────────────────
// board.mjs reads WORLD/world-state.json, and that would be the tidier seam.
// It cannot serve here yet: the fold runs at crossing saves, and at the pin
// this ships against its newest mark is dated a day before the charters were
// placed — the town-class marks are real on disk and absent from the fold. The
// fold does carry `class` and `predicated` (the board's notices depend on it),
// so when a crossing catches these up, moving this reader onto the folded store
// is a swap of loadCharters() alone.
//
// The read goes through the PINNED postmark-world package — the same pin the
// world page is served from, so the registry is exactly as fresh as the pin and
// there is no second pipeline and no second truth.
