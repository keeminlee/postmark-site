// world-feed.mjs — the rail's feed, as sentences.
//
// PURE. No DOM, no fetch, no clock of its own: every function here takes what it
// is told and returns entries. The mount draws them; the component fetches for
// it. That split is what lets the fight's whole grammar be tested against
// fixtures without a browser, which is the only way to read a combat log before
// there is a combat.
//
// THE FOUNDER'S RULING (2026-08-29), and it is one ruling, not two:
//
//   "the action log can just replace the Lately section in the side rail
//    instead of needing a whole separate panel … tweak the 'lately' section so
//    it's a newest-at-the-bottom chat-like feed, that you can scroll UP to see
//    older things (and we should use this same thing for the log in combat)"
//
// So there is ONE feed. Outside a fight it carries the rail's record and what
// the town is saying; inside one it also carries the fight. A second panel for
// combat would be the thing he ruled against, and a second component would be
// two scroll contracts to keep in step.
//
// ── WHERE THE LINES COME FROM, and why there are two derivations ────────────
//
// YOUR OWN ACTS arrive whole. The apex's act half answers `beat` (the fold's
// row for what you just did), `then` (the hostile turns your act drove), and
// `joined` / `opened` — office src/arena.mjs § 8, "the answer". Those carry the
// actor, the die, the damage and the consequence, so `beatLine` can write a
// real sentence with a real subject.
//
// EVERYBODY ELSE'S ARRIVE BY ONE OF TWO ROADS, and which one is the door's
// choice rather than ours.
//
// ① THE TAIL, where the door sends one. `encounter_detail.beats_tail` is the
// last stretch of the fold's own beats in the same shape as your own, so
// `beatsFromTail` writes WHOLE, ATTRIBUTED lines for everybody in the room —
// "the unlit cake strikes rei — 7. rei is down; the good lighter clatters to
// the floor." This is the road, wherever it exists.
//
// ② THE DELTA, where it does not. `publicState` — the encounter block the read
// half has answered until now — says out loud that it withholds beats:
// "`beats`, `ignored` and `rolls` are the fold's full working and they are NOT
// carried here: an answer that hands back every roll ever thrown in the room is
// an answer nobody reads." Against such a door another player's turn reaches
// this page only as a CHANGE IN STATE, and `beatsFromDelta` writes what the
// change can honestly support: an effect with no hand on it.
//
// ⚑ WHICH IS WHY THE DELTA'S LINES ARE IN THE RECEIVING VOICE. "rei takes 7" is
// what two reads can prove; "the cake strikes rei for 7" is not — the hand is
// not in the answer, and a log that guessed at it would be inventing the one
// fact a player most wants to trust.
//
// THE DELTA IS DEMOTED, NOT DELETED. Its own header used to say it was what
// would get deleted the day the read carried beats. It is kept as the fallback
// instead, because dev may deploy the site before or after the office in either
// order, and a page that went silent on the wrong deploy order would be worse
// than one that reads thin for an afternoon. It stands down the moment a tail
// appears, and it is the tail's PRESENCE that decides — never a version number,
// never a flag anybody has to remember to set.
