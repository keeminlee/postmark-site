   file — a prose field and nothing else required) opens THIS instead of a form.
   One line, docked over the bar, ENTER sends and ESC closes.

   It is not a second dispatch path: what leaves here goes out through the same
   dispatchEnvelope the form uses, carrying the same act name and the same field
   name off the same card. Only the chrome is different, which is the whole of
   the ruling — the grammar was never the complaint. */

/* ── the standpoint plate, ON HOVER, OVER THE DOCK ──
   RULED 2026-08-28, at the live rehearsal: "let's make the card appear ON HOVER
   when you hover over the act as bottom bar."

   IT SUPERSEDES an always-on card pinned at left 14px / top 14px, kept named here
   because a reversal that hides what it reversed reads as somebody's regression.
   That card was the second element caught sitting on the site's own left rail —
   the first was the bar, fenced at placeBar; the fix for this one was the same
   fence, and it held for parcels and failed in the open world, where the map svg
   is full-bleed and its rect's left edge IS the viewport's. There was no third
   fence worth writing. Anchored to the dock the question does not arise: the
   plate hangs off a box that is already inside the painting, exactly as the
   faces' own name boxes do, and no page furniture can be underneath it.

   Its clearance is measured against those name boxes rather than guessed: a face
   box sits at 100% + .6em and stands about two ems tall, so the plate starts
   above the tallest of them and hovering a FACE shows both without a collision. */

   covering the ACT AS caption).

   Both reveals were correct on their own: the plate answers "where am I
   standing", hung off the dock's hover by the founder's own 2026-08-28 ruling,
   and the box answers "who is this face". Hovering a FACE asks the second
   question, so the first stands down for as long as the pointer is on a face —
   the dock's own hover (its caption, its gaps) still opens the plate exactly as
   it did. Nothing is deleted; one of them waits its turn.

/* ── LATELY IS THE FEED (2026-08-29, the founder's ruling) ──
   "the action log can just replace the Lately section in the side rail instead
   of needing a whole separate panel ... tweak the 'lately' section so it's a
   newest-at-the-bottom chat-like feed, that you can scroll UP to see older
   things (and we should use this same thing for the log in combat)"

   ⚑ EVERY RULE BELOW IS CSS ON THE VIEWER'S OWN SECTION, and that is the whole
   design. The rail belongs to the viewer: it renders the Lately rows, it hides
   the section when the record is empty, and it rewrites that list on every
   re-fold. So this reshapes the section rather than replacing it — the section
   becomes the scrollport, the viewer's list is flipped to column-reverse so its
   newest-first DOM reads oldest-at-top, and the cockpit's own list is one
   element appended after it. Nothing of the viewer's is written: not its
   innerHTML, not its hidden attribute, not its state. The whole reshape is
   undone by removing one attribute from <html>, which is what destroy() does.

   The attribute is data-pmc-feed, the same shape as data-pmc-dock beside it —
   an attribute a viewer that booted after us can read, and an event
   (pm:cockpit-feed) for one that booted before. Neither is load-bearing at this
   pin; both are the seam, kept for the same reason the dock's is.

   THE COLOURS ARE THE VIEWER'S OWN VARIABLES, read off .wv, because these rules
   land inside its rail and a second palette there would be a patch of another
   page. Everywhere else in this file the cockpit is deliberately its own dark
   chrome over the painting; this is the one place it is a guest. */

/* ⚑ NOTHING IN A SCROLLPORT MAY SHRINK, and this line is the whole of "you can
   scroll UP to see older things". Found in the shot, 2026-08-29: the oldest two
   Lately rows were painted ABOVE the section's own top edge and no amount of
   scrolling could reach them.

   The cause is the flip meeting the default. A flex item shrinks by default, so
   the moment the section hit its max-height the viewer's list was squeezed below
   its content size — and a column-reverse box that is too short overflows out of
   its START edge, which is the TOP. Overflow above a scrollport's top is
   unreachable by definition: the rows were not merely off-screen, they were
   gone, and the section looked like a feed with a short memory rather than a
   broken one.

  /**
   * THE THREE RULINGS THAT ARE ABOUT PARTICULAR ACTS, kept where the other
   * name-keyed thing already lives.
   *
   * ⚑ THIS IS THE SECOND NAME TABLE ON THIS SURFACE and it is here for exactly
   * the reason the first one is. `world-cockpit.mjs` holds no verb names and a
   * falsifier greps it to keep that true; a ruling ABOUT a named act therefore
   * cannot live in the arithmetic, and `barFold` takes these as arguments so it
   * never learns one. Called with none of them it is a pure channel split.
   *
   * KEEP — founder, 2026-08-29: the room's acts plus "WALK/SAY/EXIT". The first
   * of those needs no naming: `barFold` keeps every act the door opened on the
   * ground's own channel, which IS the room's acts, whatever they are called
   * tomorrow. These are the ambient ones that hold a seat anyway — going
   * somewhere, speaking, and the way through a door are what you do in a room
   * besides fight.
   *
   * ⚑ ENTER WAS ADDED AFTER THE FIRST BUILD (conductor's ruling, 2026-08-29,
   * flagged for the founder's veto). His list named three and this is four, and
   * the reasoning for the fourth is that the list was DECLUTTERING rather than
   * hiding: the crossing act is the party's first gesture, it and the way out
   * are one pair in the record (same class, same blurb — "An entry is one
   * passage written … exit writes the next"), and folding one of a pair while
   * seating the other put the way IN behind a tray in the antechamber, which is
   * the room where it is the only thing anyone wants. Shipped as built, then
   * reversed on the reading of the shot.
   *
   * ⚑ GIVE AND TAKE JOINED THEM ON THE FOUNDER'S OWN WORD, live-testing the
   * dungeon: "give and take need to be main bar action buttons due to the item
   * you can pick up to help with the fight." That SUPERSEDES the earlier reading
   * of his keep-list, and the earlier reading is kept here rather than replaced
   * because it was not arbitrary — the original three were the acts you take
   * BESIDES fighting, and give/take were folded as things you carry everywhere.
   * What that reading missed is that in this room they are not ambient at all:
   * the good lighter is the fight's own mechanic, so picking it up and handing
   * it over are arena gestures wearing ambient verbs. A fold keyed on the
   * door's channel could not see that, because the channel is right and the
   * MEANING is what changed. Six seats now; the row still measures clear at
   * 1280 (see the shot runner, which fails the run on overflow).
   *
   * HIDE — "hide the mark and note UI buttons in the dungeon grounds", and UI
   * hiding is the whole of it: the acts are untouched, the door still affords
   * them, the MCP still takes them, and stepping back out of portal ground
   * brings the seats back. Leaving a claim on a boss room and writing yourself
   * a private note mid-fight are not what the room is for.
   *
   * GATE — the one act whose whole precondition is the phase. The office's own
   * words for it, read 2026-08-29: "Take what is left when the encounter is
   * spent. Refused while anything is still standing — the … verb's own
   * precondition is the phase." So the seat appears when the room reaches that
   * phase and not before, which is the surface agreeing with a refusal the door
   * was already going to give. `PHASES` is the office's list (encounter.mjs):
   * afoot, spent, wiped.

   * FOUNDER, live-testing 2026-08-29: "guard asks you to pick a target on the

   *
   * ⚑ AND THE CARD CANNOT TELL ME, which is the whole reason this list exists
   * rather than a derivation. The office hands ALL FIVE arena verbs the SAME
   * field object — one `object` with one description — so guarding and striking
   * are identical on the wire. The description even says so out loud: it names
   * which acts find their own target, in prose, inside a field shared by the
   * ones that do not. There is nothing in the shape to read.
   *
   * So this is a ruling in the same drawer as the other name-keyed ones, and it
   * carries the same debt: the honest fix is the office giving a self-directed
   * act a field of its own (or none at all), and then this list is deleted and
   * `aimKind` answers "none" on the card's own evidence. Asked for. Until then a
   * reader should know that "guard takes no target" is the SITE saying so.

   * The founder, 2026-08-28: "the cake ring doesn't even appear on the screen,
   * it's clipped off the bottom of the candle vault." Standing inside a three
   * by two metre room, the painting was still framed on the town — so the fight
   * was a handful of pixels at the bottom edge of a map of the county, and the
   * one thing he was fighting was off the end of it.
   *
   * ⚑ WHOSE COORDINATES THESE ARE, because on this ground it is the whole
   * question. The scene is framed on the DOOR's numbers — the standpoint, the
   * adversary's `at`, whatever is loose on the floor — and NOT on the painting's.
   * Those two disagree right now and the disagreement is not a bug in either:
   * the painting is built from the pinned world package, and the dungeon's props
   * were re-sited in a stage clone the site's build has never seen. Read live
   * 2026-08-28: the door puts the cake at (1083, -791.7), inside the vault; the
   * staged record still has it at (1097, -783.5), which is outside. The cockpit
   * already draws the ring, the token and the loose things from the door, so
   * framing on the door is what makes the camera agree with the things it is
   * pointed at. The room drawn underneath is the painting's business.
   *
   * ⚑ AND IT IS A RAW viewBox WRITE, disclosed rather than tidied away. The
   * viewer HAS a camera — `mapCtx.frameOn`, `mapCtx.setView`, `mapCtx.lockOn`,
   * every one of them better than this — but `mapCtx` is a module-local in the
   * viewer's closure and is published on nothing: not the window, not the root
   * element, not an event. There is no seam to call. So this writes the
   * attribute the viewer's own `applyView` writes, which is the same mechanism
   * one layer lower, and it accepts the cost that comes with it: a later pan,
   * zoom, follow or refit runs through `applyView` and simply wins. That is why
   * this fires on ARRIVAL rather than continuously — a camera that reasserted
   * itself every frame would fight the reader's hand for the map, and the hand
   * must win. THE CLEAN FIX IS ONE LINE IN THE VIEWER (publish mapCtx, or listen
   * for an event and call frameOn); it belongs in the world repo and a pin bump,

   * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, and it is worth stating because the map looks
   * broken rather than incomplete without it: the painting is derived from the
   * settled fold, and the fold carries the dungeon's rooms but the FIGHT is not
   * a fact of the fold at all — so a reader in the candle vault sees a floor
   * with nothing on it while the bar beside them says they are three rounds into
   * a fight with something. The cake is invisible. The answer already holds
   * everything needed to draw it; it just holds it in two pieces
   * (`adversaryPlacement` joins them, and its own note says why there is no
   * fallback coordinate here).
   *
   * SIZED IN SCREEN PIXELS, like the token and the walkers and the loose things,
   * and for the same measured reason: a figure that changed size relative to the
   * people around it would be saying something about the figure. Bigger than a
   * person because it is — the ring is the room's ninth tier of candles, not a
   * head — but bigger by a constant, so the whole scene zooms together.
   *
   * The hp bar is the door's arithmetic shown, never the site's: `hp` and `of`
   * are the numbers `publicState` sent, and a bar with either missing simply is
   * not drawn rather than guessing a full one.

   * several on a town map; in a three-metre room it is the room's whole subject
   * and the only thing anyone is looking at.
   *
   * ONE CONSTANT, THREE READERS, and that is the point of naming it. The

   * of this, the hp bar included, so the bar grows with it exactly as the

  // THE FOUNDER'S RULING, 2026-08-29: "the action log can just replace the
  // Lately section in the side rail instead of needing a whole separate panel
  // ... tweak the 'lately' section so it's a newest-at-the-bottom chat-like
  // feed, that you can scroll UP to see older things (and we should use this
  // same thing for the log in combat)."
  //
  // ONE COMPONENT, AND IT IS THE VIEWER'S OWN SECTION. The rail belongs to the
  // viewer: it writes the Lately rows and rewrites them on every re-fold. So
  // this does not replace the section, it JOINS it — the section becomes the
  // scrollport (CSS), the viewer's list is flipped to read oldest-at-top (CSS),
  // and the cockpit appends ONE element of its own after it for the fight and
  // the talk. Nothing of the viewer's is written: not its list, not its hidden
  // attribute, not its state. Remove data-pmc-feed and the rail is exactly the
  // rail it was, which is what destroy() does.
  //
  // ⚑ THE HOST IS RESOLVED AT USE TIME, never held from mount — the same law
  // that governs the svg two hundred lines up. The viewer injects its markup
  // once today, but "the element I found at mount is the element that is there
  // now" is precisely the assumption that cost this file four bugs in one
  // evening, and a feed appended to a detached rail would answer every
  // measurement with zeros while looking perfectly correct in the source.

  // ── the pin, and why it is a WATCH rather than a line of code ─────────────
  //
  // ⚑ THE FOUNDER, LIVE ON DEV 2026-08-29: "lately isn't scrolled down
  // correctly". The harness had caught the flex-shrink case; this is a
  // different failure and the harness could not have caught it, because the
  // harness's Lately rows are STATIC and the real page's are not.
  //
  // THE REAL PAGE LOADS ITS RECORD IN WAVES. The viewer calls renderActivity
  // from three separate async loads — loadWalkLedger().then(renderActivity),
  // loadSettlements().then(... renderActivity), loadStakeEvents().then(
  // renderActivity) — each of which rewrites .wv-acts's innerHTML and re-sets
  // the section's hidden attribute, at whatever moment its fetch lands. Every
  // one of those rewrites grows the content ABOVE our feed while the section
  // keeps its scrollTop, which silently walks the reader off the bottom. A pin
  // that runs once, at draw time, is pinning to a page that has not finished
  // arriving — and the later a wave lands, the further from the bottom it
  // leaves us. On a hard reload all three land after we mount, which is exactly
  // the condition he was testing under.
  //
  // So the pin follows the CONTENT, not our own writes: a mutation observer for
  // the viewer's rewrites, a resize observer for reflow that changes no nodes
  // (fonts settling, a picture arriving, a row rewrapping), and the reader's own
  // scroll as the one thing that can switch following off.
  //
  // `followBottom` is the reader's INTENT and is deliberately not re-derived
  // from the geometry on every tick: once content has grown above us we are no
  // longer at the bottom by measurement, and re-deriving would read that as "the
  // reader scrolled up" and stop following for good. It changes only when a

   * turned into a line FROM A TAIL.
   *
   * ⚑ THE WATERMARK IS ADVANCED BY THE TAIL AND BY NOTHING ELSE, and that is a
   * correctness rule rather than tidiness. Your own act answer arrives with your
   * beat AND the hostile turns it drove — seqs above anything a tail has yet
   * shown us. Letting those advance the watermark would step over somebody
   * else's beat that was sitting lower in the window and had not been read yet:
   * it would be skipped, permanently, and nothing would say so. So the act
   * answer draws its lines and leaves the watermark alone; when those same beats
   * come round in the next tail, `mergeFeed` drops them by their seq-derived id.

   * keeps. A reader arriving mid-fight must not be handed thirty lines of
   * somebody else's fight as things that just happened. An EMPTY first tail
   * seeds to -1 rather than staying unseeded, so the opening beats of a fight
   * that starts after we arrive are not the ones that get swallowed.
   *
   * ② THE DELTA, unchanged, where there is no tail. The snapshot is taken on
   * every absorb, including the one right after your own act — so your beat,
   * which already arrived whole through the act answer, is inside the baseline
   * and is never told twice.

  // it VERIFIED the result by watching for the desk to appear rather than
  // trusting a vestigial class.
  //
  // WHY IT IS GONE. The founder's governing ruling makes walking an ordinary act
  // of the one flow — button, then target, then the panel with WHO/FROM/TO and a
  // confirm — and stands the viewer's desk down so there is one way to walk
  // instead of two. A hand-off into a panel that is now hidden would arm a walk
  // a reader could never confirm, which is worse than the two-flow overlap it
  // was written to bridge.
  //
