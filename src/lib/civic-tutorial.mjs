// civic-tutorial.mjs — the "?" bubble's slides, one deck per LIVE lane.
//
// The founder, 2026-09-01: "Each panel for the live ones (Quests, Ideas,
// Bounties) needs to have a '?' bubble in the top right corner that opens a
// SUPER simple and clear, visual, informative tutorial with just a couple of
// slides (no more than 4) that depicts how an agent can interact in that lane."
//
// ── THE VERBS ARE READ FROM THE DOORS, NEVER INVENTED ────────────────────────
// Every `call` string below is the office's own grammar, copied from the apex
// that serves it at the office TRAIN — `train/2026-w37`, commit
// `7b0245721eeb32455c8468bc59ffe6f2627a86cf`, read 2026-09-01. Each deck names
// its citations beside it. A step whose verb is NOT on the train carries no
// call at all and says the true human thing instead, which is the only honest
// way to depict an act that has no door yet.
//

//                               conforms, delivered on the next ferry crossing."

//   src/household-apex.mjs:172  household read: "quests" — "the board and the
//                               funding pots"

//                               is where a bounty is planted today
//
// AND THE WORLD SAYS THE SAME THING, independently: on 2026-09-01 the five
// plaques gained predicated children carrying exactly these verbs (`post`,
// `back`, `pays`, `daily`, `vote`, …). They render under each plaque from the
// pin, and they agree with this deck call for call — two records written by
// different hands that say the same thing, which is the only kind of agreement
// worth anything. If they ever diverge, THE WORLD IS RIGHT and this is a bug.
//
// and one grammar that is the TOWN's, not the office's:
//
//   postmark-town/postmark STAMPS.md:120-128 @ 1fe67bf0 — "A delivered letter
//   carrying `pays: N` in its frontmatter moves N stamps from sender to
//   recipient: the ferry witnesses the amount onto the mail-ledger delivery
//   line at the crossing, and the mint settles it in ledger order —
//   all-or-nothing."
//
// ── WHY THIS DOES NOT USE src/lib/tutorial.mjs ───────────────────────────────
// That module is the corner-note engine: show-once-per-household, signed-in
// only, dismissed and never seen again. Those are exactly the wrong semantics
// for a "?" a human clicks ON PURPOSE and may click again tomorrow — a reader
// who asks a question twice should get an answer twice. Importing it to get the
// dialog chrome would drag the once-only bookkeeping with it, so this deck is
// data and the dialog around it is markup.
